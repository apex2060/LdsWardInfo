<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>Welcome to the awesome Ward Directory!  Here, you can organize families and individuals through tags.  You can use tags to create lists.  You can use lists to create maps, routes, and send emails.  You can take notes and associate the notes with people.  You can create assignments and make sure you followup on their fulfillment.  If you have any needs, we would love to get your suggestions and feedback.  We would love to make this a great tool for you to use.</p>
